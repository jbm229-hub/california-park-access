<h1>Accessibility of California State and National Parks</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project examines how accessible California’s state and national parks are
using both automobile and pedestrian travel metrics.  Accessibility is measured
using a traffic-weighted drivability score and walking-time isochrones derived
from OpenStreetMap pedestrian networks.  Demographic characteristics of
populations within walking distance of parks are summarized using U.S. Census
American Community Survey (ACS) tract-level data.

<h2>Data Sources and Preparation</h2>

<h3>Transportation and Park Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>California Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT):</strong><br>
    Obtained from <em>gis.data.ca.gov</em>, prepared by the California Department
    of Transportation (Caltrans). Data were originally provided as line and point
    geometries in GeoJSON format and represent recent traffic counts on major
    roadways.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>California State Park Boundaries:</strong><br>
    Downloaded from <em>parks.ca.gov</em>, originally provided as a shapefile.
    Boundaries were reprojected and clipped to the California state boundary.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>National Park Service Points of Interest:</strong><br>
    Provided by the National Park Service as a GeoJSON dataset. Only visitor
    centers were retained to represent meaningful park access points.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Census Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>U.S. Census Tracts (2023):</strong><br>
    Downloaded from the U.S. Census TIGER/Line files.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates:</strong><br>
    Population, median age, and median household income were accessed via the
    Census API at the tract level.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Processing and Quality Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All datasets were projected to a common CRS (EPSG:4326) for spatial analysis.</li>
  <li>Spatial joins were used to associate census tracts with metropolitan areas
      and to intersect tracts with walking isochrones.</li>
  <li>Traffic counts were converted to numeric values and missing or invalid AADT
      values were set to zero.</li>
  <li>Demographic summaries within isochrones were area-weighted to account for
      partial tract overlaps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Static Maps</h2>

<h3>State Park Drivability</h3>
<iframe src="state_park_drivability.html" height="855" width="95%"></iframe>
<p>
This map shows a traffic-weighted drivability score for California state parks.
The score is calculated using an inverse-distance weighted average of nearby
AADT values, representing relative ease of automobile access.
</p>

<h3>National Park Drivability</h3>
<iframe src="nat_park_drivability.html" height="855" width="95%"></iframe>
<p>
This map applies the same drivability metric to national park visitor centers,
highlighting differences in accessibility between metropolitan and remote areas.
</p>

<h2>Interactive Map</h2>

<h3>Walking Isochrones and Demographics</h3>
<p>
The map below displays pedestrian isochrones (15–60 minutes) around national
park visitor centers. Pop-ups summarize population, median age, and median
household income for census tracts intersecting each isochrone.
